# XAI explanations in Pima Indians Diabetes Prediction

**Description**: This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.

**Content**: The solution provided here is a standard pipeline to perform binary classification. Its main difference is the explanation of the methods of explainability of models (XAI): SHAP, LIME and Performance Importance. All of this was done in Portuguese, given the low amount of content in the Brazilian Portuguese language.
