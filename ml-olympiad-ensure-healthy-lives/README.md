**Description**: Competitors will have to create models to predict which agent causes severe acute respiratory syndrome based on patient data and symptoms. You can participate in the competition individually or in pairs. As it is structured data, we consider the challenge to be a basic/intermediate level, ideal for those who are starting in the data area and want to test their knowledge and exchange experiences. The first three winners will win gifts from the Google experts program (submission/group prize).

**Content**: The solution provided here is a standard pipeline to perform binary classifications + apply complex ML models ensemble to achieve an unique goal. 

All of this was done in Portuguese, given the low amount of content in the Brazilian Portuguese language.
