# Scania APS Analysis through Inference and Prediction Model Approach
**Description**: The dataset consist of a challenge presented by **Scania** in a 2016 conference. There are scientific works refered in *Conference References* created to this dataset. This dataset presents several problems:
- A high quantity NA values
- High number of correlated variables
- Unbalanced labels

**Content**: The solution provided here is a pipeline based in feature selection techniques, missing data analysis and machine learning. To see more, you can find within this folder my notebook (with explanations) and the real code, generated using *Rstudio*.
